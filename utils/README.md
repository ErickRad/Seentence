## 🧠 Overview

**Sentence** is a transformer-based neural network created to extract features from images and, through a context behind it, generate a coherent caption based on the vocabulary, combining advanced deep learning techniques.

### Why Sentence?

- 🦾 **Powerful Architecture**: Combines Transformers to Vision, Encoder and Decoder for best results
- 🎯 **End-to-End Workflow**: Supports training, inference, and model management with configurable hyperparameters.
- 📊 **Progress Visualization**: Tracks training metrics with integrated plotting tools for performance monitoring.
- 🛠️ **Custom Data Pipelines**: Facilitates preprocessing, tokenization, and batching tailored for image captioning tasks, allowing you to create your own vocabulary.
